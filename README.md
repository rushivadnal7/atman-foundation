# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Here's how and where you can effectively use the colors in the suggested palette on your NGO charity website:

### 1. **Primary Color - Deep Blue (#004085)**
   - **Use For:**
     - **Header and Navigation Bar:** Creates a strong, reliable first impression.
     - **Buttons:** Especially for primary calls to action (e.g., "Donate Now," "Get Involved").
     - **Links and Icons:** Ensures consistency and draws attention without overwhelming.

   - **Where:**
     - Across the entire site for key elements like the top navigation, footer, and interactive buttons.

### 2. **Secondary Color - Warm Red (#E63946)**
   - **Use For:**
     - **Donation Buttons:** Encourages users to act with a sense of urgency.
     - **Important Notices or Alerts:** Grabs attention for time-sensitive or important information.
     - **Highlighted Text:** Emphasizes critical content within a block of text.

   - **Where:**
     - In strategic areas where you need to drive action, such as donation pages, campaign highlights, or volunteer sign-up sections.

### 3. **Accent Color - Soft Yellow (#F4D35E)**
   - **Use For:**
     - **Banners or Callout Sections:** Adds warmth and draws attention to special features or sections like upcoming events or success stories.
     - **Hover Effects:** Can be used as a background color or border on hover states for buttons and links.
     - **Subtle Backgrounds:** Can be used for cards, badges, or section backgrounds to differentiate content blocks.

   - **Where:**
     - On landing pages, promotional banners, event notices, and in sections meant to inspire positivity and engagement.

### 4. **Neutral - Light Gray (#F7F7F7)**
   - **Use For:**
     - **Backgrounds:** A neutral backdrop that doesnâ€™t compete with the content, ideal for main content areas.
     - **Forms:** Can be used as the background for input fields or entire form sections.
     - **Borders or Dividers:** Light enough to create separation without being visually distracting.

   - **Where:**
     - Throughout the site for large background areas, around text content, forms, or sections that need subtle differentiation.

### 5. **Text Color - Charcoal (#333333)**
   - **Use For:**
     - **Body Text:** Ensures high readability and good contrast against the light gray background.
     - **Subheadings and Secondary Text:** Adds a slight hierarchy while maintaining clarity.
     - **Paragraphs, Lists, and Content Blocks:** Keeps the site content clear and easy to read.

   - **Where:**
     - Across all text-heavy areas, including blog posts, about pages, service descriptions, and any long-form content.

### **Implementation Example:**
- **Header:** Deep Blue background with white text and Warm Red for the "Donate" button.
- **Main Sections:** Light Gray background with Charcoal text and Soft Yellow call-to-action areas.
- **Footer:** Deep Blue with Soft Yellow links and Charcoal text.  -->
